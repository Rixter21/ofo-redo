## Implementation Details

### Content Security Policy

The following CSP has been implemented:

```javascript
app.use(
  helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: [
        "'self'",
        "'unsafe-inline'",
        "cdn.tailwindcss.com",
        "unpkg.com",
      ],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "cdn.tailwindcss.com"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "*.webp"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'"],
      fontSrc: ["'self'"],
      objectSrc: ["'none'"],
      mediaSrc: ["'self'"],
      frameSrc: ["'none'"],
      reportUri: "/csp-report",
    },
  })
);
```

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting has been implemented for the email endpoint:

```javascript
const emailLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5, // 5 requests per windowMs
  message: { message: "Too many requests, please try again later" },
  standardHeaders: true, // Return rate limit info in the `RateLimit-*` headers
  legacyHeaders: false, // Disable the `X-RateLimit-*` headers
});

app.post("/send-email", emailLimiter, async (req, res) => {
  // Email handling logic
});
```

### Input Validation and Sanitization

Email validation and sanitization example:

```javascript
// Sanitize and validate email
const email = validator.normalizeEmail(req.body.email);
if (!validator.isEmail(email)) {
  logger.warn(`Invalid email address: ${req.body.email}`);
  return res.status(400).json({ message: "Invalid email address" });
}

// Sanitize name and message
const name = validator.escape(req.body.name);
const message = validator.escape(req.body.message);
```

### Error Handling

Global error handling middleware:

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  // Log error
  logger.error(
    `${err.status || 500} - ${err.message} - ${req.originalUrl} - ${
      req.method
    } - ${req.ip}`
  );

  // Don't expose error details in production
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
    return res
      .status(err.status || 500)
      .sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "404.html"));
  }

  // In development, provide error details
  res.status(err.status || 500).json({
    message: err.message,
    error: err,
  });
});
```

## Security Monitoring

The monitoring script (`scripts/setup-monitoring.js`) checks the website health and can be configured to send alerts for any issues. It should be set up as a cron job to run regularly.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the HTTPS implementation on Hostinger
2. Set up regular dependency updates and security audits
3. Implement additional monitoring for security events
4. Conduct a thorough security audit after deployment
