# Public Folder HTML Audit

**Date:** March 9, 2025  
**Auditor:** Cline  
**Current Working Directory:** /home/ric/Code/ofo-redo

## Overview

This audit examines all HTML files in the `/public` directory to ensure they have proper content, consistent navigation, correct routing, and meet the overall site standards. This is an important focus area as these are the primary user-facing pages of the website.

## Navigation Standardization

### Standard Navigation Structure

All service and main pages should include:

1. Fixed navigation bar with:

   - Logo linked to index.html
   - Mobile menu toggle button
   - Desktop navigation links: Home, About, Services dropdown, Resources, Case Studies, Blog, Contact
   - Properly implemented Services dropdown with complete service listings and Premium Enterprise Solutions section
   - Mobile navigation drawer with the same links

**Note:** The Navbar on all pages should resemble the Navbar on the HomePage/index.html for consistency across the site. This includes styling, functionality, and content structure.
blog.html should contain real blog posts.

2. Footer with:
   - Quick Links section
   - Contact information with accurate details
   - Social media links
   - Technology logos section
   - Copyright information with current year
   - Legal links (Privacy, Terms, Sitemap)

## Specific Issues Found

### 1. CaseStudies.html - FIXED ✅

The CaseStudies.html page previously linked to a generic placeholder page but has now been fixed to point to the specific case study pages:

```html
<a
  href="case-studies/telemedicine-platform.html"
  class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 flex items-center transition-colors"
>
  Read Case Study <span class="ml-2">→</span>
</a>
```

All three case studies now correctly link to their respective detailed pages:

- Telemedicine Platform → case-studies/telemedicine-platform.html
- Enterprise Resource Planning → case-studies/enterprise-resource-planning.html
- Decentralized Finance Platform → case-studies/defi-platform.html

### 2. products.html - FIXED ✅

The products.html page now uses relative paths for images and links:

```html
<img
  src="assets/images/ai-chip.webp"
  alt="AI analytics platform interface showing data visualizations"
  class="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-lg mb-4"
  loading="lazy"
/>
```

```html
<a
  href="CloudSolutions.html"
  class="inline-block bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-purple-600 hover:from-blue-700 hover:to-purple-700 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-md transition-colors duration-300"
>
  Learn More
</a>
```

This change ensures the site will function correctly regardless of the domain or subdirectory it's hosted in.

### 3. products.html - Alpine.js Directives - FIXED ✅

The products.html page previously used Alpine.js directives (@click, :class, etc.) for interactive elements, which was inconsistent with the rest of the site. This has been fixed by replacing them with standardized data attributes:

From:

```html
<button
  @click="toggleMobileMenu()"
  class="md:hidden text-white hover:text-yellow-500 focus:outline-none"
></button>
```

To:

```html
<button
  data-mobile-menu-button
  aria-label="Toggle mobile menu"
  aria-expanded="false"
  class="md:hidden text-white hover:text-yellow-500 focus:outline-none"
></button>
```

This change ensures consistent JavaScript interaction patterns across the entire site.

From:

```html
<img src="/assets/images/ai-chip.webp" alt="AI analytics platform interface" />

```

To:

```html
<img src="assets/images/ai-chip.webp" alt="AI analytics platform interface" />
<a href="CloudSolutions.html">Learn More</a>
```

### 3. ✅ COMPLETED: Alpine.js vs Data Attributes

All Alpine.js directives in products.html have been replaced with standard data attributes to match the rest of the site's components:

From:

```html
<button
  @click="toggleMobileMenu()"
  class="md:hidden text-white hover:text-yellow-500 focus:outline-none"
></button>
```

To:

```html
<button
  data-mobile-menu-button
  aria-label="Toggle mobile menu"
  aria-expanded="false"
  class="md:hidden text-white hover:text-yellow-500 focus:outline-none"
></button>
```

Other Alpine.js directives including:

- `@mouseover="openDropdown(true)"` → `id="services-dropdown"`
- `:class="isMobileMenuOpen ? 'max-h-[500px]' : 'max-h-0'"` → `data-mobile-menu`
- `@click="toggleServices()"` → `data-services-button`
