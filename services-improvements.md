## Remaining Tasks

The following issues still need to be addressed:

1. **CSS/JS Optimization**:

   - Multiple CSS files (`services.css`, `services-premium.css`, etc.) are loaded separately. Combine them to reduce HTTP requests.
   - Tailwind CSS is loaded after custom styles, risking unintended overrides. Load Tailwind first.

2. **Broken Interactive Features**:

   - Missing JavaScript implementations for:
     - Metric counters (data-value attributes)
     - Service filtering (Core/Specialized tabs)
     - FAQ accordions
     - Comparison table tier toggles
   - Mobile menu dropdown functionality relies on unspecified Alpine.js components.

3. **Accessibility Concerns**:

   - FAQ section uses non-semantic divs instead of `<details>`/`<summary>` elements.
   - Some interactive elements (e.g., filter buttons) lack proper ARIA attributes.

4. **Content & Performance**:

   - Video file (`6779513_Computer_Network_1920x1080.mp4`) may have licensing and optimization issues. Recommend:
     - Verify usage rights
     - Convert to WebM format
     - Implement lazy loading
   - Logo image lacks explicit dimensions, causing layout shifts. Add `width`/`height` attributes.

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement lazy loading for service card images
   - Add loading="lazy" attribute to all images
   - Consider implementing intersection observer for better performance
   - Optimize SVG icons for faster rendering

**Recommendations**:

1. Validate all links and ensure consistent lowercase filenames.
2. Implement missing JavaScript functionality or clarify Alpine.js integration.
3. Optimize assets:
   - Convert images to WebP
   - Compress video
   - Combine CSS files
4. Fix HTML validation errors and improve semantic markup.
5. Add `aria-label` to interactive SVG icons.
6. Audit content for consistency in service descriptions and URLs.
7. Implement proper lazy loading for images/videos.
