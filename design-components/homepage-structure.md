## Content Reuse Strategy

To avoid duplication and maintain consistency:

1. **Component Templates**

   - Create reusable HTML templates for common elements (cards, buttons, badges)
   - Standardize CSS classes for consistent styling
   - Document component variations for easy implementation

2. **Content Guidelines**

   - Maintain consistent copy length for similar components
   - Use consistent terminology across all sections
   - Follow established voice and tone guidelines

3. **Visual Consistency**

   - Use defined color palette with amber/gold accents
   - Maintain consistent spacing between sections
   - Apply consistent animation effects

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Use data attributes for interactive elements
   - Implement standardized JavaScript functionality
   - Ensure all animations use the same technique (IntersectionObserver)

## Prioritization for Implementation

When creating or updating the homepage, follow this sequence:

1. Essential structural elements (navigation, hero, footer)
2. Core content modules (value proposition, solutions, case studies)
3. Enhancement modules (FAQ, client logos)
4. Animations and interactive elements
5. Performance optimizations and testing

This ensures the most important elements are implemented first, with enhancements added in a structured manner.
