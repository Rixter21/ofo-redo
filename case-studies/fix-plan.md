# Case Studies Fix Plan

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Case Study Pages**

   - Telemedicine Platform case study is referenced but returns 404 errors
   - Enterprise Resource Planning case study is referenced but returns 404 errors

2. **Template Issues**

   - template.html has incorrect path references (using "../public/assets/" instead of "../assets/")
   - This causes future case studies created from this template to have path issues

3. **Placeholder File Issues**
   - case-study.html is a basic placeholder without proper content
   - Links to case-study.html from CaseStudies.html return 404 errors

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Fix Template File

1. Update all path references in template.html:
   - Change "../public/assets/" to "../assets/"
   - Ensure image references, CSS links, and JS script references use correct relative paths
   - Update all navigation links to proper relative paths

### Step 2: Create Missing Case Studies

1. **Telemedicine Platform Case Study**:

   - Create a new case study based on the corrected template
   - Focus on HIPAA-compliant video consultation capabilities
   - Use capability-focused language instead of specific client references
   - Implement interactive elements consistent with other case studies

2. **Enterprise Resource Planning Case Study**:
   - Create a new case study based on the corrected template
   - Focus on streamlining business operations and improving productivity
   - Use capability-focused language instead of specific client references
   - Implement interactive elements consistent with other case studies

### Step 3: Fix Navigation References

1. Update links in CaseStudies.html:
   - Replace all references to "case-studies/case-study.html" with the correct paths to the new case studies
   - Ensure all links in CaseStudies.html point to existing files

### Step 4: Testing

1. Test all links in CaseStudies.html to ensure they resolve correctly
2. Test navigation within all case study pages to ensure proper back-navigation
3. Validate proper loading of all assets, CSS, and JavaScript in the new case studies
