# OFO Development Website Design Document

## Overview

The OFO Development website is designed to showcase our enterprise software development services and solutions. The site follows a modern, component-based architecture that emphasizes modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

## Design Philosophy

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Breaking down the UI into reusable, independent components
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensuring core functionality works across all devices and browsers
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes from mobile to desktop
- **Performance-First**: Minimizing load times and optimizing for core web vitals
- **Accessibility**: Following WCAG guidelines for inclusive user experience

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for better SEO and accessibility
- **CSS3/Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript for interactive elements
- **Particles.js**: For interactive background effects
- **Alpine.js**: Lightweight JavaScript framework for reactive components

## Component System

We've implemented a custom component loader system that allows for modular page building. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Maintainability**: Changes to a component only need to be made in one place
2. **Consistency**: Components ensure UI elements look and behave consistently across the site
3. **Performance**: Components can be loaded asynchronously as needed
4. **Development Efficiency**: Team members can work on different components simultaneously

### Component Loader

The component loader (`components.js`) is responsible for:

- Identifying elements with `data-component` attributes
- Loading the HTML content from the specified path
- Injecting the content into the element
- Triggering a `componentsLoaded` event when all components are loaded

### Component Structure

Components are organized in a hierarchical directory structure:

```
public/components/
├── head/
│   ├── meta-tags.html
│   ├── schema-markup.html
│   └── stylesheets.html
├── navigation/
│   ├── navbar.html
│   └── mobile-menu.html
├── services/
│   ├── hero-section.html
│   ├── filter-buttons.html
│   ├── service-cards-grid.html
│   ├── faq-section.html
│   ├── cta-section.html
│   └── service-cards/
│       ├── card-template.html

```

## Page Structure

Each page follows a consistent structure:

1. **Head**: Meta tags, schema markup, and stylesheets
2. **Navigation**: Responsive navbar and mobile menu
3. **Hero Section**: Page-specific hero section with title and description
4. **Main Content**: Page-specific content sections
5. **Call to Action**: Consistent CTA section across pages
6. **Footer**: Site-wide footer with links and contact information

## Services Page Architecture

The services page has been refactored to use a component-based architecture:

1. **Head Components**:

   - Meta tags for SEO
   - Schema markup for rich snippets
   - Stylesheets for page styling

2. **Navigation Components**:

   - Navbar with dropdown menus
   - Mobile menu for smaller screens

3. **Service Components**:

   - Hero section with page title and description
   - Filter buttons for categorizing services
   - Service cards grid for displaying services
   - Individual service cards for each service offering
   - FAQ section with accordion functionality
   - Call-to-action section

4. **Footer Component**:
   - Contact information
   - Quick links
   - Social media links
   - Copyright information

## JavaScript Architecture

The JavaScript is organized into modular files:

1. **components.js**: Core component loader functionality
2. **services.js**: Services page specific functionality
3. **components/filter-buttons.js**: Service filtering functionality
4. **components/faq-accordion.js**: FAQ accordion functionality
5. **components/comparison-toggle.js**: Service tier comparison functionality

## Styling Approach

We use a combination of Tailwind CSS utility classes and custom CSS:

1. **Base Styles**: Typography, colors, spacing
2. **Component Styles**: Specific styling for components
3. **Utility Classes**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development
4. **Custom Effects**: Animations, transitions, and interactive elements

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Component Updates**: When updating a component, ensure changes don't break other pages
2. **Testing**: Test across multiple devices and browsers after significant changes
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly check Core Web Vitals and optimize as needed
4. **Accessibility Audits**: Conduct regular accessibility audits to ensure WCAG compliance
