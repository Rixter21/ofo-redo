**Last Updated:** 2025-03-17

- Implemented robust service worker solution to prevent "ghost server" issue:
  - Created server-status.json file that's updated with timestamp when server starts
  - Modified register-sw.js to check server availability before registering service worker
  - Added periodic server availability check to service-worker.js to auto-unregister when server is down
  - Updated server.js to update the timestamp in server-status.json on startup
  - This prevents the issue where cached content continues to be served after server shutdown
  - Service worker now automatically unregisters itself when the server is unavailable

**Last Updated:** 2025-03-02

  - Added preload directives for critical above-the-fold images
  - Implemented preconnect resource hints for third-party resources
  - Deferred non-critical JavaScript loading for improved page rendering
  - Implemented service worker for offline support and improved performance:
    - Precaching of critical resources (HTML, CSS, JS, and key images)
    - Runtime caching for dynamic resources
    - Network-first strategy for HTML navigation
    - Cache-first strategy for static assets
    - Offline notification system
    - Update notification for new service worker versions
    - Exclusion pattern for contact.html and API requests to prevent caching

## Service Worker Architecture (v1.2)

**Last Updated:** 2025-03-17

### Overview

The website uses a service worker for offline support and caching. The service worker is registered in the following files:

- WebDevelopment.html
- resources.html
- blog.html

### Caching Strategy

- **HTML Navigation**: Network-first with cache fallback

  - Attempts to fetch from network first
  - Falls back to cache if network request fails
  - Caches successful network responses for future use

- **Static Assets**: Cache-first with network fallback

  - Checks cache first for CSS, JS, images, and fonts
  - Falls back to network if not in cache
  - Caches network responses for future use

- **API Requests**: No caching (excluded)
  - API requests are excluded from caching to ensure fresh data

### Server Availability Check

To prevent the "ghost server" issue where cached content continues to be served after the server is shut down:

1. **Server Status File**:

   - server-status.json file is updated with current timestamp when server starts
   - Acts as a "heartbeat" file to indicate server availability
   - Uses direct object creation instead of file reading to prevent race conditions
   - Removed excessive logging to improve performance

2. **Registration Check**:

   - register-sw.js checks for server availability before registering the service worker
   - If server is unavailable, it unregisters any existing service workers
   - Only registers the service worker when server is confirmed to be running
   - Implements request timeout (3 seconds) to prevent hanging connections
   - Validates timestamp to ensure server is recently active (within the last hour)
   - Uses cache-busting techniques to prevent stale data issues

3. **Periodic Check**:
   - service-worker.js performs periodic checks (every 30 minutes) for server availability
   - Uses setTimeout instead of setInterval for better error handling
   - If server becomes unavailable, the service worker unregisters itself
   - Includes proper error handling to prevent cascading failures
   - This ensures the service worker doesn't continue serving cached content when server is down

### Exclusions

The service worker is configured to exclude certain pages from caching:

- contact.html (to ensure form submissions are always sent to the server)
- All API requests (to ensure fresh data)

### Utilities

- **unregister-sw.html**: Utility page to manually unregister the service worker and clear cache
  - Provides detailed information about registered service workers
  - Offers buttons to unregister service workers and clear cache
  - Includes manual instructions for using browser developer tools
  - Note: Must be served from a web server to function properly
