# HTML Files Audit

**Date:** March 9, 2025  
**Auditor:** Cline  
**Current Working Directory:** /home/ric/Code/ofo-redo

## Overview

This audit examines all HTML files in the OFO Development website to identify files with missing content, incorrect path references, or other issues that need to be addressed before the site can be considered production-ready.

## Critical Issues

1. **Missing/Incomplete Case Study Pages**

   - Several case study pages referenced in CaseStudies.html show 404 errors when clicked
   - The `case-studies/case-study.html` file is a placeholder that doesn't match the design of other case studies
   - Links to case study pages like `/case-studies/saas-platform` and `/case-studies/mobile-banking` don't exist

2. **Path Reference Issues**

   - `case-studies/template.html` has incorrect path references using "../public/assets/" instead of "../assets/"
   - `public/products.html` uses absolute paths like "/assets/images/" which may cause loading issues
   - Several links in case-study.html use absolute paths with "/public/" prefix

3. **Navigation Inconsistencies**
   - `public/products.html` still uses Alpine.js directives (@click, @mouseover) instead of data attributes
   - `case-studies/case-study.html` has simplified navigation that doesn't match the standardized pattern

## Missing Case Study Pages

The following case study pages are referenced in CaseStudies.html but do not exist:

1. **Telemedicine Platform** - referenced but returns 404
2. **Enterprise Resource Planning** - referenced but returns 404
3. **Mobile Banking App** - referenced in case-study.html but doesn't exist
4. **Enterprise SaaS Platform** - referenced in case-study.html but doesn't exist

## Implementation Plan

1. **Fix Existing Files**

   - Update path references in `case-studies/template.html` to use correct "../assets/" prefix
   - Fix path references and navigation in `public/products.html` to match standardized pattern
   - Create proper content for `case-studies/case-study.html` or redirect links to existing case studies

2. **Create Missing Case Study Pages**

   - Create full Telemedicine Platform case study based on corrected template
   - Create full Enterprise Resource Planning case study based on corrected template
   - Either create Mobile Banking App and Enterprise SaaS Platform case studies or remove references

3. **Update CaseStudies.html**
   - Fix links to point to existing case studies
   - Ensure all featured case studies have corresponding pages

## Timeline

- Template fix: 1 hour
- Fix products.html: 1 hour
- Create missing case studies: 4-6 hours per case study
- Fix CaseStudies.html links: 1 hour

## Conclusion

While the majority of the website is well-implemented with capability-focused content and consistent navigation, the case study section requires immediate attention to fix missing content and incorrect references. The products.html page also needs updates to match the standardized navigation pattern and fix path references.

These issues should be prioritized as part of the final steps toward making the website production-ready.
