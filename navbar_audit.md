   <!-- Current implementation (no link) -->
   <div class="flex items-center">
     <img
       src="assets/images/logos/Color logo - no background.png"
       alt="OFO Development"
       class="w-48 max-w-[180px] max-[480px]:max-w-[120px] h-auto transition-transform hover:scale-105 hover:brightness-125"
     />
   </div>

   <!-- Recommended implementation (with link) -->
   <div class="flex items-center">
     <a href="index.html" aria-label="OFO Development Home">
       <img
         src="assets/images/logos/Color logo - no background.png"
         alt="OFO Development"
         class="w-48 max-w-[180px] max-[480px]:max-w-[120px] h-auto transition-transform hover:scale-105 hover:brightness-125"
       />
     </a>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Fix GameDevelopment.html Dropdown Menu**:
   - Add the missing service pages to the dropdown menu to match the implementation in index.html
   - Ensure all 16 service pages are listed in the dropdown menu

## Conclusion

The navbar audit revealed two specific issues that need to be addressed to ensure consistency across all service pages:

1. The logo on DevOpsSolutions.html does not link to the home page
2. The dropdown menu on GameDevelopment.html is missing 4 service pages

These issues should be fixed to maintain a consistent user experience across the entire website. All other service pages have properly implemented navbars that match the reference implementation on index.html.
